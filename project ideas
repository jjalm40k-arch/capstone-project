1) Persoanl Library Management System: A simple persoanl library management site. 
This would allow the user to input to input the details of their personal library 
(such as an actual library room within their home, or something basic like a single bookshelf in their bedroom).
This includes labeling the spaces books are stored (Bookshelf 1, 2, etc. & how many shelves each has for example),
as well as what books these contain. 
Each book would have a basic description: Title, Author, Genre, short description, location, typical library info.
There would be functions to "take out" books from the library, for when a book is removed to be read.
Also a function to permanently remove the book from the library (whether donated, sold, etc).
A simple AI-powered external API could be added as a way to get book recommendations.
Eg. Describing a genre or topic you want to read next and the AI giving a short list of recommendations from the books available 
(if any match)

2)TTRPG Character Builder: One of my favorite hobbies is playing TTRPGs like D&D with my friends.
As someone who plays these games though, building characters form the ground up is one of the biggest barriers of entry that new players experience (it took me 2+ hours with help the first time I had to make a D&D character)
The goal of this site would effectively build a character sheet for you after asking a few basic questions.
For example, the D&D 5e version would ask you: What class are you playing? What level? etc.
It would then access information form a sight like Wikidot 5e (which has all player facing info for 5e available for free)
As you go along the questionaire it would offer recommendations: ex. When selecting a race it would recommend races that boost strength to those who chose barbarians,
potential spell choices for classes with access to spellcasting, useful feats if high enough level to access those, etc.
Once all questions have been answered a final character sheet would be generated using the data collected so far that the player could then download as a pdf preferably.
As I mainly play D&D this would proabbly be D&D 5E only, as I know this game system well enough to give strong recommendations for most builds that can be built into the logic of the site.
While I have played other systems like LANCER and Pathfinder 2E, I don't have nearly enough experience in thsoe systems to give good character building ideas.
